The solar system is a gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

Topic Shift. Now let's discuss something completely different. Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

Back to the solar system. The solar system also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed of rock and metal, like the terrestrial planets.
